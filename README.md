# Predator-Prey Ecosystem Simulation with Fuzzy Logic

## Introduction and Problem Statement

This project implements an agent-based simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem using fuzzy logic for decision-making. The simulation models the complex interactions between predators (carnivores), herbivores, and vegetation (grass) in a constrained environment, addressing one of the fundamental challenges in ecological modeling: how to accurately represent the behavior of different species within an ecosystem.

In natural ecosystems, population dynamics are governed by complex relationships between species, resource availability, and environmental factors. Traditional mathematical models like the Lotka-Volterra equations provide analytical frameworks for predator-prey relationships but often fail to capture the nuanced decision-making processes of individual organisms. They typically model populations as continuous variables rather than discrete agents with distinct behaviors.

This simulation aims to bridge this gap by using an agent-based approach where each entity (predator, herbivore, grass) is modeled as an independent agent with its own state and decision-making capabilities. The key innovation in our approach is the implementation of fuzzy logic "brains" for the animals, allowing them to make decisions based on imprecise information about their environment, similar to how real animals might behave.

The simulation addresses several key questions:
1. How do predator and prey populations evolve over time in a closed ecosystem?
2. What factors contribute to stable population dynamics versus extinction events?
3. How do individual agent decisions based on fuzzy logic affect macro-level ecosystem patterns?
4. What parameter values lead to sustainable coexistence between species?

By implementing this simulation, we aim to create a platform for experimenting with different ecological parameters and observing emergent behaviors in complex ecosystems.

## State of the Art

### Traditional Ecological Models

The foundation of most predator-prey modeling begins with the Lotka-Volterra equations, developed independently by Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra in the 1920s. These differential equations model the cyclical population dynamics between predators and prey:

```
dx/dt = αx - βxy
dy/dt = δxy - γy
```

Where:
- x represents the prey population
- y represents the predator population
- α, β, δ, and γ are parameters representing growth rates and interaction effects

While these equations provide valuable insights into population dynamics, they make several simplifying assumptions, including homogeneity among individuals and continuous population changes rather than discrete events.

More sophisticated extensions include:

1. **Rosenzweig-MacArthur Model** (1963): Incorporates carrying capacity and functional responses to create more realistic dynamics.
2. **Arditi-Ginzburg Ratio-Dependent Model** (1989): Considers that predation depends on the ratio of predators to prey, not just their absolute numbers.

### Agent-Based Modeling Approaches

Agent-based models (ABMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for ecological simulations. Notable frameworks include:

1. **NetLogo** (Wilensky, 1999): A widely-used platform for ABM with built-in predator-prey examples like "Wolf Sheep Predation" [1].

2. **MASON** (Luke et al., 2005): A Java-based multiagent simulation toolkit used for various ecological simulations [2].

3. **Mesa** (Python): A modern agent-based modeling framework in Python, which we've adapted for our implementation [3].

The emergence of agent-based approaches is well-documented in DeAngelis and Grimm's paper "Individual-based modeling in ecology: what makes the difference?" (2014), which highlights how individual-based models capture heterogeneity, local interactions, and adaptive behaviors that aggregate models cannot [4].

### Fuzzy Logic in Ecological Modeling

Traditional agent-based models often use simple if-then rules or probability-based decisions. However, real animals make decisions based on imprecise, "fuzzy" information about their environment.

Fuzzy logic, introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965, provides a mathematical framework for handling imprecise information and partial truths. In ecological modeling, fuzzy logic has been applied in various ways:

1. **Behavioral Models**: Teixeira et al. (2015) applied fuzzy logic to model fish behavior, showing how it can represent more realistic decision-making [5].

2. **Habitat Suitability**: Fuzzy logic has been used to model habitat suitability for different species, as shown in Adriaenssens et al.'s work (2004) [6].

3. **Movement Decisions**: Morales et al. (2005) demonstrated how fuzzy logic can be applied to model animal movement patterns based on environmental cues [7].

The application of fuzzy logic to ecological modeling is well-visualized in this diagram from Barros et al. (2000):

### Recent Advancements

Recent work has focused on integrating machine learning with agent-based models. For example:

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Gomes et al. (2019) combined deep reinforcement learning with agent-based models to allow agents to learn adaptive behaviors over time [8].

2. **Hybrid Models**: Vincenot et al. (2017) proposed hybrid models that combine system dynamics with agent-based approaches for more comprehensive ecological modeling [9].

## Description of Your Solution

Our solution implements a predator-prey ecosystem simulation using the Mesa framework for agent-based modeling, with custom fuzzy logic decision-making for the agents. The simulation consists of three types of entities:

1. **Grass**: Simple agents that can grow and spread to neighboring cells.
2. **Herbivores**: Animals that consume grass, avoid predators, and reproduce.
3. **Predators**: Animals that hunt herbivores, manage energy, and reproduce.

### System Architecture

The system is organized into several key components:

1. **Base Agent Class**: Provides common functionality for all animals (movement, energy management, reproduction).
2. **Fuzzy Logic Brain**: Implements the decision-making logic for agents.
3. **Simulation Model**: Manages the environment, agents, and simulation steps.
4. **Visualization**: Displays the simulation state and collects data for analysis.

### Fuzzy Logic Implementation

The core innovation in our solution is the fuzzy logic decision-making system. We implement this through the following components:

#### Fuzzy Variables

Each agent considers several fuzzy variables:

**For Herbivores:**
- Energy level (low, medium, high, full)
- Food proximity (near, medium, far)
- Predator proximity (very_near, near, medium, far)

**For Predators:**
- Energy level (low, medium, high)
- Prey proximity (near, medium, far)
- Prey count (few, some, many)

Each fuzzy set is defined by a membership function. For example, the energy level "low" might be defined as:

```python
lambda x: max(0, min(1, (0.3 - x) / 0.3)) if x < 0.3 else 0
```

This function maps a crisp input value (energy level) to a degree of membership between 0 and 1.

#### Fuzzy Rules

We define rules that connect input conditions to output actions. For example:

```python
# When predator is very near, sprint away (emergency escape)
self.add_rule(
    {"predator_proximity": "very_near"},
    ("movement", "sprint", "sprint"),
    weight=1.0  # Highest priority - immediate danger
)
```

Each rule has antecedents (conditions), a consequent (action), and a weight (priority).

#### Fuzzy Inference

The inference process involves:
1. **Fuzzification**: Converting crisp input values to fuzzy membership degrees
2. **Rule Evaluation**: Calculating the firing strength of each rule
3. **Aggregation**: Combining the outputs of all rules
4. **Action Selection**: Determining the final action based on rule strengths

For example, a herbivore might decide to "flee" if it detects a predator nearby, "seek_food" if it's hungry and spots grass, or "seek_partner" if it has high energy and no immediate threats.

### Agent Behaviors

**Herbivores:**
- Scan for predators in surrounding cells
- Evaluate energy level, food proximity, and predator proximity
- Make movement decisions: flee, sprint, seek food, seek partners, or wander
- Consume grass when available
- Reproduce when energy is high and conditions are favorable

**Predators:**
- Scan for herbivores in surrounding cells
- Evaluate energy level, prey proximity, and prey count
- Make hunting decisions: conserve energy, stalk, or chase
- Consume herbivores when captured
- Reproduce when energy is high

### Environment Management

The environment is a 2D grid where:
- Grass grows at a rate controlled by configuration parameters
- Growth rate adapts based on current grass coverage
- Agents move and interact within the grid boundaries
- Energy flows through the system: from grass to herbivores to predators

### Parameter Tuning

A significant aspect of our solution involves careful tuning of parameters to achieve balanced population dynamics:
- Energy values and consumption rates
- Reproduction thresholds and costs
- Detection ranges and reaction weights
- Movement capabilities and limitations

These parameters were iteratively adjusted based on simulation results to find configurations that allow sustainable coexistence between species.

## Results and Analysis

Our simulation produces rich datasets that allow us to analyze population dynamics and ecosystem behavior. We collect data on:
- Population counts for each species
- Grass coverage percentage
- Energy distribution among agents
- Cause of death statistics
- Movement and decision patterns

### Population Dynamics

Typical simulation runs show cyclical patterns in population dynamics:

1. **Initial Growth Phase**: Herbivores multiply rapidly as they consume available grass.
2. **Predator Response**: Predator population increases in response to herbivore abundance.
3. **Herbivore Decline**: Predation pressure and resource competition lead to herbivore population decline.
4. **Predator Decline**: With fewer herbivores, predators begin to starve and decline.
5. **Recovery Phase**: Grass recovers, allowing herbivore population to rebound, starting the cycle again.

However, the exact patterns depend significantly on parameter settings:

- **High Predator Efficiency**: When predators are too efficient at hunting, herbivores may be driven to extinction, followed by predator extinction.
- **Low Predator Efficiency**: When herbivores are too good at evading, predators may starve while herbivores overpopulate and then crash due to resource depletion.
- **Balanced Parameters**: With properly tuned parameters, we observe stable oscillations in populations that persist over time.

### Effect of Fuzzy Logic Decision-Making

Our experiments showed that fuzzy logic decision-making leads to more realistic and nuanced behaviors compared to simpler rule-based approaches:

1. **Contextual Decisions**: Agents make different decisions based on multiple factors (energy, threats, opportunities).
2. **Weighted Priorities**: Rather than binary choices, agents balance competing priorities based on current conditions.
3. **Emergent Behaviors**: Complex group behaviors emerge from individual decision-making, such as herbivores clustering in areas with both food and safety from predators.

### Comparative Analysis

We compared different configurations to understand their impact on ecosystem stability:

1. **Detection Range**: Increasing detection range for herbivores led to better predator avoidance but sometimes resulted in predator starvation.
2. **Energy Balance**: Lower energy costs for movement resulted in more active agents but could lead to overpopulation.
3. **Reproduction Thresholds**: Lower reproduction thresholds increased population growth rates but often led to boom-bust cycles.

The most stable ecosystems emerged when:
- Herbivores could detect predators but not perfectly evade them
- Energy costs were significant enough to require resource management
- Reproduction required substantial energy investment

### Visualization and Data Collection

Our simulation includes real-time visualization using Pygame, showing:
- Grass as green background of varying intensity
- Herbivores as blue circles
- Predators as red circles

After simulation ends, we generate plots showing:
- Population changes over time
- Relationship between predator and prey populations
- Moving averages of population sizes
- Ecosystem composition over time

## Conclusions

Our predator-prey simulation with fuzzy logic decision-making demonstrates several important insights about ecosystem modeling:

1. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules at the individual level can lead to complex, system-wide behaviors.
2. **Balance is Delicate**: Sustainable ecosystems require careful parameter tuning; small changes can lead to extinction events.
3. **Fuzzy Logic Advantage**: The fuzzy logic approach provides more nuanced and realistic decision-making compared to binary rule systems.
4. **Individual Variability**: Even with identical decision rules, individual agents follow different trajectories based on their unique experiences and environmental contexts.

### Limitations and Future Work

Our current implementation has several limitations that could be addressed in future work:

1. **Spatial Heterogeneity**: The environment is uniform; adding terrain features or resource patches would create more interesting dynamics.
2. **Learning and Adaptation**: Agents currently don't learn from experience; implementing reinforcement learning could allow agents to adapt strategies over time.
3. **Species Diversity**: Adding more species and trophic levels would create more complex food webs.
4. **Environmental Factors**: Incorporating seasonal changes or external disturbances would test ecosystem resilience.

### Technical Challenges

During development, we encountered several technical challenges:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing simulation complexity with computational efficiency.
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Finding parameter sets that lead to stable but interesting dynamics required extensive experimentation.
3. **Agent Coordination**: Ensuring proper agent interaction without centralizing control was challenging.

In conclusion, our fuzzy logic-based predator-prey simulation provides a valuable platform for exploring complex ecosystem dynamics and offers insights into how individual decision-making processes affect population-level outcomes. The approach demonstrates the power of agent-based modeling combined with fuzzy logic for ecological simulation.
